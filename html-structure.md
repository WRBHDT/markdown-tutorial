# Building the HTML Structure

Here, we will create the HTML structure of a web page. This includes coding the document type, adding a title, and creating some basic elements, such as headings and paragraphs.

## Steps to Create the HTML File:
1. **Create an HTML file**:
   Create a new file called `index.html` in the repository.

2. **Define the document structure**:
   Here's the basic structure of an HTML document:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>My Simple Web Page</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
       <p>This is a simple web page built with HTML and CSS.</p>
   </body>
   </html>
